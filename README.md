# Remote Model Rocket Launcher

This is the code for a remote controlled model rocket launcher i built a few years back. The motivation is striaghtfoward, I wanted to be able to more easily watch the model rocket from a distance rather than bend my neck to look straight up. This devices is purposefully over redudant with more switches than necessary because why not? It's funner to flip more switches. If you do decide to use this code use at your own risk. Always hard disconnect from rocket engine until read for firing.
